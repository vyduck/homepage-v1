                Lights off is a simple game where the player has to turn off all the lights. I have implemented
                different difficulty levels and different sizes from 4x4 grid to 8x8 grid.

                I created this bot in the first week of July, 2024 with inspiration from a Reddit user.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                It tracks how much time you spend in a voice channel. This data can then be used to generate
                leaderboards.
                The bot also allows users to group channels, for example, there might be a productivity group, a gaming
                group, or just a chatting group. Leaderboards can also be generated using these groups.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                The bot is written in <span class="imp">JavaScript</span> and uses <span class="imp">NodeJS</span>
                runtime. It stores information using <span class="imp">MongoDB</span>.
                It communicates with Discord using the <span class="imp">discord.js</span> module.

            <p class="project-description">
                I created this bot in Feb, 2024. And then forgot about it due to exams.
                When my exams ended in June, 2024, I started to improve the bot, but realized it would be better to
                rewrite it. So, I re-wrote the bot in the last two weeks of June 2024 with some new features.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                Tally can keep count of anything that could be counted in numbers. Kills in a game, total steps walked,
                total words written, etc.
